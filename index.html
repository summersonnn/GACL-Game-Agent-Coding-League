                            Game Agent Coding League (GACL) is a benchmarking framework designed for LLMs in which
                            models are tasked with generating code for game-playing agents. These agents compete in
                            games such as Battleship, Tic-Tac-Toe variants, and others. At present, the league supports
                            five games, with additional titles planned.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For each game, a base implementation is provided, including the core game logic and an
                            initialized—but empty—agent class. Models receive this code along with the game rules,
                            scoring details, and other relevant information. After a model generates its agent
                            implementation, the output is parsed and inserted back into the game environment. A
                            matchmaking system then schedules matches between all agent pairs, producing a final
                            leaderboard.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each model is prompted twice, meaning every model submits two separate agents. During
                            matchmaking, agents from the same model do not compete against each other. Instead, each
                            agent plays against all non-friendly agents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When compiling performance charts, only the stronger of a model's two agents is considered;
                            the weaker one is excluded.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each game carries a specific weighting coefficient, and the overall leaderboard is
                            calculated by combining scores across games according to these weights.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each matchup between two agents is made up of multiple individual games, all using the same
                            point allocation system. A win awards 3 points, a loss gives 0, and a draw grants 1 point to
                            each side. In addition, there is a separate “score” metric, which functions as a secondary
                            tiebreaker—similar to goal difference in football.

                            The way this score is calculated varies by game, so you need to refer to the full game
                            prompts for detailed scoring mechanics.

                            On the leaderboard, performance is tracked at the game level, not the match level.
                            Therefore, if a model is listed as having played “10” games, that refers to 10 individual
                            games—not 10 matches.

                            Example:
                            Suppose mistral’s first agent plays a match against qwen’s second agent, and that match
                            consists of 100 games. The leaderboard is updated based on the results of each of those 100
                            games separately, with all points and scores recorded on a per-game basis.
                        </p>

                                    A territorial strategy game set on a 24-position Nine Men's Morris board. Players
                                    place and then maneuver seven pieces each, attempting to eliminate the opponent by
                                    surrounding their pieces so they lack empty adjacent spaces and are numerically
                                    overpowered. Captures follow strict "suicide-first" and self-harm priority rules.
                                    Games can end by elimination, immobilization, repetition, or turn limit.

                                    compete using King, Knight, Rook, and Pawn pieces to checkmate the opponent's King.
                                    White pieces occupy columns a-c, Black pieces occupy columns f-h, with columns d-e
                                    initially empty. Knights have enhanced movement including L-shaped jumps and
                                    2-square horizontal leaps. Pawns promote to Rooks when reaching the far end.
