                    <p class="mb-3">
                        Game Agent Coding League (GACL) is a benchmarking framework designed for LLMs in which
                        models are tasked with generating code for game-playing agents. These agents compete in
                        games such as Battleship, Tic-Tac-Toe variants, and others. At present, the league supports
                        five games, with additional titles planned.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-semibold text-red-600">
                        Models produce code that can play games rather than playing the games themselves. Their sole
                        interaction occurs at the stage of code creation. As a result, this benchmark is hybrid in
                        nature, combining elements of both code generation and reasoning.
                    </p>

                <!-- Methodology -->
                <section>
                    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Methodology</h2>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        For each game, a base implementation is provided, including the core game logic and an
                        initialized—but empty—agent class. The function signature is shared with the model but the
                        implementation is left empty. Models receive this code along with the game rules, scoring
                        details, and other relevant information. After a model generates its agent implementation,
                        the output is parsed and inserted back into the game environment. A matchmaking system then
                        schedules matches between all agent pairs, producing a final leaderboard.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        Each model is prompted twice, meaning every model submits two separate agents. During
                        matchmaking, agents from the same model do not compete against each other. Instead, each
                        agent plays against all non-friendly agents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When compiling performance charts, only the stronger of a model's two agents is considered;
                        the weaker one is excluded. You can find links to the raw scoreboards—where both agents
                        appear—on the Leaderboard page.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <!-- Point System -->
                <section>
                    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Point System</h2>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        Each matchup between two agents is made up of multiple individual games, all using the same
                        point allocation system. A win awards 3 points, a loss gives 0, and a draw grants 1 point to
                        each side. The way a win, loss, or draw is determined varies by game—refer to the full game
                        prompts for detailed scoring mechanics.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        Performance is tracked at the game level, not the match level. If a model is listed as having
                        played "10" games, that refers to 10 individual games—not 10 matches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="font-medium text-gray-800">Example:</span> Suppose Mistral's first agent plays a
                        match against Qwen's second agent, and that match consists of 100 games. The leaderboard is
                        updated based on the results of each of those 100 games separately, with all points recorded
                        on a per-game basis.

                    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Unified Model Source</h2>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        All models are accessed through the OpenRouter API, providing a single, consistent interface
                        across providers. When multiple providers serve the same model, we select only those that
                        support fp8 quantization or better, ensuring inference quality is not a confounding variable
                        in the results.

                    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Overall Score</h2>
                    <p>
                        Each game carries a specific weighting coefficient. The overall leaderboard is calculated by
                        combining each game's normalized score (0–100), multiplied by its weight, divided by the total
                        weight of games the model participated in.

                <!-- Underperformance Check -->

                    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Unexpected Underperformance</h2>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        Do you think one of the models performed significantly worse than expected in a particular game?
                        That might simply be due to chance. To address this, we’ll request updated agent code from each
                        model for every game on a biweekly basis. Then, the lowest-performing agent (among the existing
                        three) will be
                        eliminated. After making these adjustments, we’ll run the evaluation again. Ideally, the new
                        agent will replace the one that underperformed unexpectedly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also note that when building the leaderboards and charts, we only consider the top-performing
                        agent from each model (out of two agents). So there is already a safeguard in place to mitigate
                        this issue.
